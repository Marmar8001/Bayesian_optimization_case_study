# Bayesian_optimization_case_study

This repository demonstrates the use of Bayesian methods for hyperparameter optimization. In addition to traditional methods like random search and grid search, Bayesian methods utilize probabilities to select optimal hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

The `BayesianOptimization` library is used for hyperparameter tuning. You can find detailed documentation for this library (https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization).

The code demonstrates how Bayesian optimization works by constructing a posterior distribution of functions (Gaussian process) that describes the function being optimized.

The example includes:

1. A simple function optimization
2. A real-world example using the LightGBM algorithm for flight delay prediction

The code showcases feature engineering techniques and demonstrates the use of Bayesian hyperparameter optimization to identify the best parameters for the LightGBM model.

Please refer to the provided code and comments within the notebook for more details.
